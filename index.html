<h2>David Eck's JavaScript Page</h2>

<p>Here are some entertaining and/or educational programs, written in JavaScript so that
they will work on the Web.  All of the programs use HTML canvas for drawing.  Most
modern web browsers support it; however, you might run into some old browsers that don't.
Note that in many browsers (Chrome and Firefox, at least), you can right-click a canvas and choose a command such
as "View Image" or "Save Image" to save a copy of the drawing.
The program should work with a touch screen, as well as with a mouse.

<ul>
<li><a href="genetic-algorithm/GA.html">Genetic Algorithms Demo</a> &mdash; A simulation of
evolution using a genetic algorithm.  You can design a "world" and see how some very simple,
simulated "organisms" evolve in that world.</li>
<li><a href="mandelbrot/MB.html">Explore the Mandelbrot Set</a> &mdash; A program for visualizing
the famous Mandelbrot set, which lets you zoom in to any degree and control the colors that are
used for the visualization.</li>
<li><a href="sorting/xSortLab.html">Sorting Algorithms</a> &mdash; Watch visual demos of
five common sorting algorithms, and time how long they take to sort large arrays.</li>
<li>Three programs for drawing with symmetry groups in the plane:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="symmetry/wallpaper.html">Wallpaper Groups</a> &mdash; Draw symmetric patterns using
    any of the 17 wallpaper groups, which have translation symmetry in two independent directions.</li>
    <li><a href="symmetry/frieze.html">Frieze Groups</a> &mdash; Draw symmetric patterns using any
    of the 7 frieze groups, which have translation symmetry in one direction only.</li>
    <li><a href="symmetry/rosette.html">Rosette Groups</a> &mdash; Draw symmetric patterns using rotation
    and dihedral groups, which have rotation and/or reflection symmetry but no translation symmetry.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><a href="turing-machine/TM.html">Turing Machine Simulation</a> &mdash; Create and run examples of
the abstract computing devices known as Turing Machines. (Mostly for people interested in the
foundations of theoretical computer science.)</li>
<li><a href="pentominos/pentominos.html">Pentominos Puzzle Solver</a> &mdash; A pentomino is a
polyhedron made up of five squares of the same size.  This program will solve puzzles where
the goal is to place the twelve possible pentominos on a board.</li>
<li><a href="xTurtle/xTurtle.html">xTurtle</a> &mdash; A "turtle graphics" program that lets the
user write programs and give individual commands in a made-up turtle graphics programming language.</a>
<li><a href="xLogicCircuits/xLogicCircuits.html">xLogicCircuits</a> &mdash; A simulator for logic circuits that lets you
build circuits from AND, OR, and NOT gates.  Includes the ability to create subcircuits and then use
them to build more complex circuits.</li>
<li><a href="xModels/xModels.html">xModels</a> &mdash; A graphics program that lets users specify 3D scenes
and animations in a simple scene description language.  It is meant for learning about geometric modeling,
not for making pretty pictures.</li>
<li><a href="xComputer/xComputer.html">xComputer</a> &mdash; A simulator for a very simple, made-up model
computer, with an assemble to convert assembly language programs into machine language and an
emulator that shows the step-by-step execution of machine language instructions.</li>
<li><a href="chaos-game/CG.html">Chaos Game</a> &mdash; Design self-similar fractals,
which are visualized by the program using a random process.</li>
<li><a href="edge-of-chaos/CA.html">Cellular Automata and the Edge of Chaos</a> &mdash; Make images produced by
the evolution over time of one-dimensional cellular automata, and explore the idea that the most
interesting cases tend to arise when the automaton is on the "edge of chaos."</li>
<li><a href="datareps/xDataReps.html">xDataReps</a> &mdash; A small web app that tries to illustrate various
interpretations of a given 32-bit binary number.</li>
<li>Three programs for graphing functions of one variable.  These are not as polished as they could
be.  I plan to work on a larger variety of similar programs.
    <ul>
    <li><a href="graphs/grapher.html">Basic Grapher</a> &mdash; Graphs a function entered by the user.</li>
    <li><a href="graphs/function-family.html">Families of Functions</a> &mdash; Graphs a function that can depend on up to four
    parameters, with sliders for changing the parameter values.</li>
    <li><a href="graphs/derivatives.html">Derivatives</a> &mdash; Graphs a function along with its first and
    second derivatives, and can draw tangent lines to the functions when the user drags the mouse on the
    graph.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>A few small examples, mostly for amusement:
   <ul>
   <li><a href="video-poker/index.html">A Video Poker Slot Machine Game</a></li>
   <li><a href="poker-solitaire/index.html">A Simple Poker Solitaire Game</a></li>
