<h2>xSortLab: Info and Instructions</h2>

<p>The program <a href="xSortLab.html">xSortLab.html</a> is meant to help you learn
about common sorting algorithms.   To "sort" an array means to put the items in the
array into increasing, or decreasing, order.  A sorting algorithm is a specific
technique for doing so.  There are many well-known sorting algorithms.  xSortLab
works with the algorithms named Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort,
Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.</p>

<p>For more information about sorting, you might check out
the Wikipedia article on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">sorting&nbsp;algorithms</a>.
That page has links to individual articles on each of the sorting algorithms that
are implemented in xSortLab.</p>


<hr align="center" width="33%">

<p>The xSortLab web page is divided into three sections.  The top section is
"Visual Sort."   This section applies sorting algorithms to arrange
16 bars in order of increasing height, while showing the step-by-step
details of the process.  Below the area where the bars are
displayed are two message areas, which display a running commentary when
a sort is in progress.  The lower message area displays a detailed comment
on each step in the sort.  The upper area displays more general messages
about major phases in the sort.  (The lower message area is not used when
the sort is being run at "Fast" speed.)</p>

<p>To the right of the bars is a column of controls.  The first of these
is a pop-up menu, that can be used to select the sorting method.
Clicking "New Sort" will rearrange the bars into a random order and
get ready to start the sorting algorithm.
The "Step" button does one step in the algorithm, while the "Run"
button executes the steps automatically.  There is a checkbox
labeled "Fast" that will speed up the process significantly by
reducing the delay between steps and by omitting the animations that
show a bar moving from one location to the next&mdash;instead, they
just jump to the new location.</p>

<p>Two basic operations are used in sorting:  <b>comparing</b> two items to
see which is bigger and <b>copying</b> an item from one place to another.  The number
of comparisons and the number of copies used in the current sort are
displayed below the controls.</p>

<p>You would typically use the Visual Sort panel by stepping slowly through the algorithm
to see how it works in detail.  You should also run it at fast speed from beginning to end to
get a better overview of the process as a whole.</p>

<hr align="center" width="33%">

<p>The second section of xSortLab is "Timed Sort."  This section is used to obtain
statistics about the running times of the five sorting algorithms.  The 
interesting question is how the running time depends on the number of
items being sorted.  You can enter the size of the array that is to be
sorted.  You can also specify the number of arrays to be sorted.
The point is that a small array takes so little time to sort that
the time cannot be measured accurately, so the program can be set
to sort several arrays of the same size.  The time required to sort
one array can then be computed
by dividing the total time by the number of arrays.  You probably
want to adjust the number of arrays so that the total time is at
least one second.</p>

<p>The arrays in this case are arrays of numbers.  The program begins
by creating the arrays and filling them with random numbers.  It is not
possible to work with more than 500 million numbers, so there are
limits on the array size and on the number of arrays.  You should only
consider sorting very large arrays when the algorithm is Quick Sort
or Merge Sort.</p>

<p>The timing statistics should be fairly accurate, as long as your computer
is not busy with too many other tasks at the same time that you are doing
the sort. (Also,if the number of arrays is very large and the array size is
very small, the overhead involved in managing the arrays might distort the
results somewhat, since the overhead is inclueded in the measured time.)</p>

<p>A timed sort uses a web browser capability called a "web worker,"
which should be available in all modern browsers.  If you are using an
old browser that does not support web workers, the Timed Sort option will
be disabled.</p>

<hr align="center" width="33%">

<p>The third section of the page is a "Log."  Every time the program completes
a sorting operation, it will write statistics about the operation to the log.
If this annoys you, there is a checkbox that you can uncheck to disable logging.
The statistics are output as a table that you can easily copy-and-paste into
a text editor if you want to save the data.</p>

<p>For a visual sort, the number of arrays is always 1, the array size is
always 16, and the elapsed time is omitted from the log.</p>
