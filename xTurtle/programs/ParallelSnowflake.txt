{ This program demonstrates the "fork"
  command, which is used in xTurtle 
  to simulate multiprocessing.  The
  command "fork(6)" makes six turtles.
  The turtles are identical, except
  that each one has a different
  "ForkNumber".  By using ForkNumber
  in the program, you can make the 
  turtles behave differently. The
  following program uses three levels
  of forking to draw a snowflake-like
  picture.

fork(6)
face(60 * forkNumber)
forward(6)
fork(6)
face(60 * forkNumber + 30)
forward(2)
fork(6)
face(60 * forkNumber)
forward(0.7)
