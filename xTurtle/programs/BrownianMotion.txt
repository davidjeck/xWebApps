{ A multitasking program in which six turtles all do
  "random walks", using six different colors.  A random walk
  in this case means selecting a direction at random and
  moving forward a small amount, and repeating that forever.
  If a turtle moves of the screen, it jumps back to the
  center.
   
  SUGGESTED: Run at "Fastest" speed with "Hide Turtles" enabled.

                         turtle, this lets each turtle draw with
