<h1>xComputer Info</h1>
<hr>

<p><a href="xComputer.html">xComputer</a> is a kind of simulation of a very simple
model computer.  (It imitates the step-by-step execution of machine language
instructions, but not the hardware of a computer.)
It does not simiulate any specific, real computer, but is very loosely
based on the 6502 processor, which was
used in the Commodore 64 computer in the early 1980s, and its design is
appropriate to that time frame.  The orginal xComputer simulator was written
to accompany <i>The Most Complex Machine</i>, a textbook that I published in
the 1995.  The current version, which runs on a web page, retains the
essential features of the original.</p>

<p>A computer stores programs and data in its <span class="term">main
memory</span> (or &quot;RAM&quot;).  It has a <span class="term">central
processing unit</span> (or &quot;CPU&quot;) that fetches instructions
from memory, one-by-one, and executes each instruction.  This is called
the <span class="term">fetch-and-execute cycle</span>.  In xComputer, a single
fetch-and-execute cycle is itself made up of small steps.  Each of these
little steps performs a very simple operation, such as copying data from
one location inside the CPU to another, adding two numbers, or moving 
information between main memory and the CPU.  Each step is accomplished
by turning <span class="term">control wires</span> on and off.  These
control wires are attached to the main memory and to various components
in the CPU.  A <span class="term">control circuit</span> turns the control wires 
on and off, based on just a few pieces of information, including
the instruction that is being executed and the value of a
<span class="term">counter</span> that counts off the little steps of
each fetch-and-execute cycle.  All the values that the CPU is currently
working with are stored in <span class="term">registers</span>,
which are small memory units contained within the CPU.  The whole process
is driven by a <span class="term">clock</span>.  Each time the
clock ticks, one step of a fetch-and-execute cycle is performed.</p>

<p>That's a very brief description of the fundamental operation of a 
computer.  With some extensions, most of it is still true of all existing computers.
The xComputer implements this fundamental operation for a computer
with a 1024-location RAM and eight registers.  Like any computer,
the xComputer has a certain set of <span class="term">machine
language instructions</span> that it understands.  Machine language
instructions are actually binary numbers and are not really meant to be
read or written by humans.  Programs for the xComputer are therefore
usually written in <span class="term">assembly language</span>.
An assembly language program must be translated into machine language before
it can be executed by a computer.  The <a href="#language">assembly&nbsp;language</a> for xComputer has
31 different instructions, which are listed <a href="#instructions">below</A>.</p>

<hr align=center width="33%">

<p>The <a href="xComputer.html">xComputer web page</a> has two main sections.  
At the top is a text editor where an xComputer assembly language program
can be entered.  And on the bottom is the xComputer simulator itself.</p>

<p>Above the text area is a popup menu that lists some sample programs
that are available.   Selecting an item from the popup menu will
show the corresponding program in the text editor.  The web page attempts to load eight 
sample programs into the popup menu.  You can learn a lot about xComputer and
its assembly language by reading the first five or six sample programs.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new program of your own, select "[New&nbsp;Program]"
from the pop-up menu.  The text area will be cleared, and you can enter your
your program there.  The "Save" button lets you save the program from the text area
to a local text file on your computer. The "Load" button lets you select a
text file on from your computer to be loaded into the text area.
In most browsers, saving and loading files will use file save/open dialogs similar
to those used in other programs.  (Some browsers still use an older kind of file
handling. In those browsers, saving a file will look just like downloading a
file from the Internet, and loading a file will
look like uploading a file to the Internet.)  Saving and loading files is new
in November, 2023.</p>

<p>Beneath the text editor is a "Load Program into xComputer" button.  Click that
button to load the program into the simulator.  But if
there are syntax errors in the program, an error message will be displayed
below the text editor instead.  In the case of an error, the input cursor
in the text editor will be moved to the point in the program where
the error was found.  Only the first syntax error in the program is
found and reported.  (For undefined word errors, the error occurs
at the end of the program, when no definition has been found for the word.)</p>


<hr>
<h3 id="running">The xComputer Simulator</h3>

<p>The point of the simulator is to illustrate the
step-by-step operation of a computer as it executes a program.
When the web page is loaded, it displays a text box where programs
can be entered and edited, with the actual simulator at the bottom
of the page.  The editor should show a sample program, with more
sample programs available in a pop-up menu above the editor.
The text of each sample program includes information about the program and
about xComputer.  You can also enter your own programs.
To start a new program, just select '[New&nbsp;program]' from
the popup menu.  To translate the program in the editor into machine language
and load the program into xComputer's memory, click the
"Load Program into xComputer" button.  Here, to give you an idea of what
assembly programs look like, is a really trivial program
that adds 7 and 18 and puts the answer into memory location number&nbsp;10:</p>

<pre>             LOD-C 7
             ADD-C 18
             STO 10
</pre>

<p>The simulator is divided into several sections:
a &quot;Control&quot; area, a set of &quot;Registers&quot;, a set of
"Control Wires", and two views of "Memory".
One view of memory is a scrolling list that
displays 1024 memory locations, numbered from 0 to 1023.  Each location
contains a 16-bit binary number that can be interpreted either as data or
as a machine language instruction.  The second view of memory, on the
far right, is a graphical display of the same information. (See the
sample program named "Graphics View of Memory" in the pop-up menu
of program.) The Registers section  shows eight registers that are components in the xComputer's
Central Processing Unit.  The registers are explained <A HREF="#registers">below</A>.
The Controls are for interacting with and controlling the xComputer.
Finally, the Control Wires section lists xComputer's 26 control wires.
The name of a control wire is highlighted when that control wire is
on (except that there is no highlighting when the program is
being executed at fast speed).</p>

<p>Suppose that you have some assembly language program in
the program editor.  Before xComputer can do anything with that program,
it must be translated into machine language and put into xComputer's
main memory. To do this for a program in the editor, click the
"Load Program into xComputer" button.  If an error is found in
the program, an error message will be displayed below the editor.  If the program contains
no errors, it will be put into xComputer's memory,  You can then run the program
or step through it, as described <A HREF="#running">below</A>.</p>


<p>The question remains, exactly what sort of thing can be stored in
memory?  The first thing you need to understand is that what is
really in each main memory location and in each register is a binary number.  Any other
form of information must be represented somehow as a binary number.  The same binary
number can represent different values, depending on how it is
interpreted.  In xComputer, there are several formats for entering and viewing
the values that are actually represented internally as binary numbers:</p>

<UL>
<LI><span class="term">Integer</span> &mdash; any whole number in the range 
-32768 to 32767.
<LI><span class="term">Unsigned integer</span> &mdash; any whole number
in the range from 0 to 65535.  (Thus, you can actually use any number
from -32768 to 65535.  However, numbers from -32768 to -1 and from 32768 to
65535 are ambiguously represented by the same binary numbers.)
<LI><span class="term">Assembly language instruction</span> &mdash; any legal
assembly language instruction for xComputer, such as 
&quot;<span class="cmd">LOD-C&nbsp;17</span>&quot;.
(See the list <A HREF="#instructions">below</A>.)
<LI><span class="term">ASCII characters</span> &mdash; a single quote, followed
by any typeable character or a pair of characters (except for carriage return).
The quote just marks this as ASCII data.  For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;'DE
<LI><span class="term">Hexadecimal number</span> &mdash; a dollar sign ($)
followed by from one to four hexadecimal digits.  For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;$A73D
<LI><span class="term">Binary number</span> &mdash; a B (upper or lower case)
followed by from 1 to 16 zeros and ones.  For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;B110010111010
</UL>

<p>So, a binary number
in memory can represent several different things.  The xComputer simulation
allows you to select how you want to view the binay numbers that are stored
in memory.  Select the view that you want from the pop-up menu above the memory
display.  The &quot;Instructions&quot;, &quot;Integers&quot;, &quot;Unsigned Ints&quot;,
&quot;Binary&quot;, and &quot;ASCII&quot; display styles correspond to some of
the data types listed above.  (In the ASCII display style, two characters
are shown in each memory location.  Non-printing characters are shown as
ASCII code numbers enclosed between &lt; and &gt;.  For example,
&lt;#17&gt; represents the character with ASCII code number 17.)
There is a similar pop-up menu in the Registers area to select how you
want to view the contents of the registers.</p>

<HR>
<H3 id="running">Running a Program</H3>

<p>A program consists of a series of instructions stored in memory.
The computer fetches instructions one-by-one and executes them.  The
<span class="term">program counter register</span> (or &quot;PC&quot;) 
tells the computer
which address to go to in memory for the next instruction.  When you want
to run a program, you should always first check that the value in the PC register
is the address of the location that contains the first instruction of
the program.  You can set the value in the PC to zero using the
&quot;Set&nbsp;PC=0&quot; button. To set the PC to some other
value, type the value into the &quot;Addr&quot; box and then click on the
&quot;Addr&nbsp;To&nbsp;PC" button.  
Note that when you use the &quot;Load Program into xComputer&quot; button 
to put a program into memory, the PC will automatically be set to
zero at the same time.  However, after you run the program once, you would
have to reset the PC manually if you want to run it again.</p>

<p>Once you have set the PC, there are three different ways to run the
program:</p>

<UL>
<LI>Click the &quot;Step&quot; button.  This performs one of the several small
steps that make up each fetch-and-execute cycle.  You have to click on this
between five and ten times, depending on the instruction, to execute each 
instruction.  Note that the names of the control wires that were turned on for the
step are highlighted.  Any registers affected by the step are also highlighted.
<LI>Click the &quot;Cycle&quot; button.  This is meant to perform one complete
fetch-and-execute cycle.  More exactly, it performs &quot;step&quot; operations
until the value in the COUNT register is zero, marking the end of one fetch-and-execute cycle.  At that point, the instruction
in the IR register has just beeen executed.  You don't see the individual steps, 
and there is no highlighting of registers or control wire names.
<LI>Click the &quot;Run&quot; button.  This makes the computer execute instructions
continually, like a real computer.  The &quot;Run&quot; button changes into a
&quot;Stop&quot; button, which you can use to stop the computer.  The computer will also
stop if it executes a HLT instruction.  The speed at which the computer runs
is determined by a pop-up menu just below the run button. At "Fast Run Speed",
the contents of registers are updated, but control wires are not highlighted.
At the &quot;Fastest Run Speed&quot;, neither registers nor control wires are
updated.  The "Fast Run Speed" executes about 60 instructions per second, while
"Fastest Run Speed" executes about 600 per second.
</UL>

<hr>
<H3 id="registers">Registers and Control Wires</h3>

<p>The xComputer has eight registers.  A register is a memory unit that holds
one binary number.  Different registers holds different numbers of bits.
Each of the registers has a role to play in fetching and executing instructions.
Here is a short description of the purpose of each register:</p>

<UL>
<LI><span class="term">ADDR register</span>:  The address register is a 16-bit register that holds the
          address of a location in memory.  Whenever data is read from or
          written to memory, this is the address that is used.  (If you turn on the
          &quot;Autoscroll&quot; checkbox, below the scrolling memory display, then any
          time the value in ADDR changes, the memory will be scrolled to ensure
          that that memory location is visible in the display (except when the computer is running
          at fast speed.)
<LI><span class="term">PC register</span>:  The program counter is a 10-bit register that
          contains the address in memory of the next program instruction
          that is scheduled to be executed.  The PC is
          ordinarily incremented by 1 during each fetch-and-execute cycle.
          Its value can be also be changed by the execution of a jump
          instruction, which tells the computer to jump to a different
          location in the program and continue execution from there.
<LI><span class="term">IR register</span>:   The instruction register is a 16-bit register that
          holds a program instruction while it is being executed.
          This is where an instruction is put when it is fetched from memory.
<LI><span class="term">COUNT register</span>:  This is a 4-bit register that
          counts off the steps in each fetch-and-execute cycle.  At the beginning
          of each step, its value is incremented by one.  The last step of the
          cycle resets this register to zero, so that the next cycle can begin.
<LI><span class="term">AC register</span>:  The accumulator is a 16-bit register
          that holds a number that is being used
          in the current calculation.  When a number is loaded from
          memory, it is put in the AC.  When a number is stored into memory, the
          value is taken from the AC.  When a number is &quot;added&quot;, it
          is added to the value currently in the AC, and the result is
          put back into the AC.  Etc.
<LI><span class="term">FLAG register</span>:  This is a 1-bit register that
          can give extra information about a calculation.  For example,
          when two 16-bit numbers are added, the final &quot;carry&quot; into
          the 17-th column is stored in the FLAG register.  When a
          shift operation is performed on the AC, the extra bit that
          is shifted off the end is placed into the FLAG register.
<LI><span class="term">X and Y registers</span>:  These are 16-bit registers that
          hold numbers that are to be used in
          a calculation.  For example, when two numbers are to be
          added, they are placed into X and Y.  (The Y register is
          also used as a temporary storage place in a few cases.)
</UL>

<p>The X and Y registers are connected to the inputs of an <span class="term">Arithmetic-Logic
Unit</span>, or &quot;ALU&quot;, which does all the arithmetic and logical calculations
in the computer.  The outputs of the ALU are connected to the AC and to the FLAG
register.  (The ALU is not shown in the xComputer simulation.)</p>

<p>The components of the computer &mdash; including the main memory, the registers, the clock,
and the ALU &mdash; are controlled by turning wires on and off.  These wires are connected to 
various components of the computer, and they control the operation of those components.
It is these &quot; control wires&quot; that make the steps of the fetch-and-execute
cycle happen. 
For example, in step #1 of each fetch-and-execute cycle, the control wire
named &quot;Load-ADDR-from_PC&quot; is turned on.  This causes the number stored
in the PC &mdash; which is the location of the instruction that is to be fetched &mdash; 
to be copied into the ADDR register &mdash; where it sets up the main memory for
reading from that location.  The purposes of most of the wires are clear from their
names.  (The first seven wires, whose names start with &quot;Select-&quot;,
are connected to the ALU.  The ALU can perform several different calculations.
The Select wires are used to tell it which calculation it should do.)</p>

<HR>
<H3 id="language">The Assembly Language of xComputer</h3>

<p>An assembly language program is simply a way of specifying a sequence of 16-bit
binary numbers to be stored in the computer's memory.  As such, it can include
any of the data items described above:  Assembly language instructions, numbers
in the range -32768 to 65536, hexadecimal numbers (up to four digits, preceded by $),
binary numbers (up to 16 bits, preceded by B or b), and ASCII characters (one or two
characters, preceded by a single left quote mark).</p>

<p>The legal instructions are listed <A HREF="#instructions">below</A>.  An instruction
consists of a two- or three-character code, such as <span class="cmd">LOD</span>,
<span class="cmd">OR</span>, and <span class="cmd">HLT</span>.  Since upper and
lower case letters are not distinguished, these could also be written as 
<span class="cmd">lod</span>, <span class="cmd">or</span>, and 
<span class="cmd">hlt</span>.  In some cases, this instruction code can
be followed by an <span class="term">addressing mode</span>, indicated
by &quot;-C&quot; for &quot;constant&quot; addressing mode and by
&quot;-I&quot; for &quot;indirect&quot; addressing mode.  The addressing mode
indicates how the data for the instruction is to be used.  For example,
<span class="cmd">ADD-C&nbsp;17</span> indicates that the constant, 17, is
to be added to the number in the accumulator, while <span class="cmd">ADD&nbsp;17</span>
indicates that a number is to be read from memory location 17 and 
added to the number in the accumulator, and <span class="cmd">ADD-I&nbsp;17</span>
indicates that location 17 holds a memory address and the number from that 
address is to be added to the value in the accumulator.</p>

<p>As you can see, the data for the
instruction simply follows the instruction.  It must be on the same line.  You can't
split instructions over two lines, and you can't have more than one instruction 
on a line.  Not all instructions need data.  If you provide data for an instruction
that doesn't need it, it is legal, but the data will be ignored when the instruction
is executed.  The data for an instruction is a 10-bit binary number.  It can be
given in any of the following forms:</p>

<UL>
<LI>a number between 0 and 1023,
<LI>a binary number between B0 and B1111111111,
<LI>a hexadecimal number between $0 and $3FF,
<LI>a single ASCII character, preceded by a left single quote mark,
<LI>a label name.
</UL>

<p>The last possibility &mdash; a label name &mdash; brings us to a whole new aspect of
assembly language.  An assembly language program can contain more than just a
sequence of items representing 16-bit numbers.  It can contain other things
to make programming easier by letting the computer do more of the work.  A label
is a name that stands for a number.  A label represents a 10-bit binary
value and can appear anywhere in the program where such a value could be 
used, that is, as the data part of an instruction or as a stand-alone item
on a line by itself.  When the program is translated, the label is replaced by
the number it represents.  A label is given a value by using it to label
one of the 16-bit items that make up the program.  To define a label in this
way, the label name must be the first thing on the line,
followed by a colon (:) and the item that it labels.  The value of the label is
the address of the location in memory that contains that item.  For example,
the following program adds up all the numbers from 1 to 50:</p>

<pre>
               lod-c 1       ; Initialize number to contain 1.
               sto number
               lod-c 0       ; Initialize sum to contain 0.
               sto sum
         next: lod sum       ; Add current value of number to sum.
               add number
               sto sum
               lod number    ; Add one to the value of number.
               inc
               sto number
               sub-c 51      ; Subtract 51 from the number, which is still in AC.
               jmz done      ; If the answer is zero, jump to &quot;done&quot;.
               jmp next      ; Otherwise, jump to &quot;next&quot; to continue the computation.
         done: hlt           ; Halt. 
          sum: 0             ; (The zeros are place-holders to reserve memory
       number: 0             ;     locations for sum and number.)
</pre>

<p>In this program, <span class="cmd">next</span>, <span class="cmd">done</span>,
<span class="cmd">sum</span>, and <span class="cmd">number</span> are
labels.  The labels <span class="cmd">next</span> and <span class="cmd">done</span>
refer to locations that hold instructions. The labels <span class="cmd">sum</span> and
<span class="cmd">number</span> refer to locations that hold data for the program.
The programmer can work with the instructions and data without having to work out
the actual location numbers.  (This program also illustrates <span class="term">comments</span>.
Anything on a line after a semicolon (;) is treated as a comment and is ignored
by the computer.)</p>

<p>There are a few more things you can do in an assembly language program.
A program item can be preceded by a number followed by a #.  This is a
repetition count and is the same as typing the item the specified number
of times.  For example, &quot;25#&nbsp;17&quot;  puts a 17 in each of the next 25
memory locations.  &quot;4#&nbsp;SHL&quot; is equivalent to four SHL instructions
in a row.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, a program is loaded into consecutive memory locations starting at
location 0.  However, you can specify where loading is to take place
by using the character @ followed by an address.  For example, &quot;@100&quot;
specifies that the next item is to go into memory location 100.  (Items following that one
will then go into location 101, 102, etc.)  You might use this feature to put
subroutines or data at specific points in memory.</p>

<p>You can use the special word "data" to represent the binary number zero.  This is meant
to provide a more meaningful way to reserve memory locations for storing data.  For example,
the line "num:&nbsp;data", which is equivalent to "num:&nbsp;0", reserves a space in memory
and assigns it the label <i>num</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can store a string of ASCII characters into consecutive memory locations
by using a <span class="term">string</span>.  A string is just a series of
characters enclosed between double quotes, such as <span class="cmd">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span>.
When the computer encounters a string in a program, it stores
the characters in consecutive memory locations, one per location.</p>

<p>Not every binary number represents a legal assembly language instruction.  When xComputer
tries to execute such an instruction, it simply ignores it.  That is, illegal instructions
are treated as "no-ops"; they perform "no operation".</p>

<HR>
<H3 id="instructions">List of Assembly Language Instructions</h3>

<p>Here is a complete list of the assembly language instructions for xComputer.
In this listing, &quot;X&quot; is data for the instruction; it must represent

<h3 id="logisim">A Logisim Simulation of xComputer</h3>

<p>Logisim is a free program that can simulate logic circuits.  Logisim is a fairly old program, but
is very good at what it does.  It is written in Java, so to use it, you need to have a Java 
runtime environment installed on your computer.  You need to download <a href="logisim.jar">logisim.jar</a>,
which is the executable jar file that contains the program.  And you need to know how to run an
executable jar file (basically, enter <i style="white-space:pre">java -jar logisim.jar</i> on the
command line in the directory that contains the file logisim.jar).  Once you have Logisim running, you
can find extensive information about it in its "Help" menu.</p>

<p>I decided to make a simulation of the xComputer model computer in Logisim, to make sure that it could
actually be done.  The simulation is in a file, <a href="xComputer.circ">xComputer.circ</a>, that you can download and
open in Logisim, using the "Open" command in the Logisim "File" menu.  If you want to see what the
xComputer simulation looks like in Logisim, see <a href="xComputer-in-Logisim.png"
style="white-space:pre">xComputer-in-Logisim.png</a>.  Even if you don't want to try the
simulation, the picture is a nice illustration of how all the components of xComputer are
wired together.</p>

<p>This simulation does not really serve any purpose, except to illustrate that it can be done.
But if you would like to try it, you will want load an xComputer program into the simulation's
RAM (that is, its main Memory).  As an example, the file 
<a href="TheBasics-for-Logisim-RAM.txt" style="white-space:pre">TheBasics-for-Logisim-RAM.txt</a> 
contains the first sample program from the <a href="xComputer.html">xComputer&nbsp;app</a>,
in the syntax required for a Logisim memory file.  To use it, download the file, open the xComputer
simulation in Logisim, right-click the RAM component at the lower right in the simulation, and
select "Load Image" from the popup menu.  Click the Clock component at the upper right of the
simulation (using Logisim's "Poke" tool) to perform one step in the execution of the program.
(Make sure "Simulation&nbsp;Enabled" is checked in the "Simulate" menu.  Use "Ticks&nbsp;Enabled"
in that menu to run the simulation automatically.)
Note that the xComputer control wires that are on for that step will be shown in a brighter green.</p>

<p>The "Grab Memory for Logisim" button at the very bottom of the <a href="xComputer.html">xComputer&nbsp;app</a>
can be used to extract the current contents of the xComputer memory from the app, in the format
that is needed for loading into Logisim.  A&nbsp;popup dialog will appear with a text area
containing the contents of memory.  You can copy-and-paste from the text area into a text
editor and save the data in a plain text file.  The popup dialog can be closed by clicking
the "Dismiss!" button or by pressing the Escape key.</p>
