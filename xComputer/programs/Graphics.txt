; This is a very simple program that is meant to demonstrate the
; graphical memory display that is shown on the right edge of
; the xComputer below. Each pixel in the the graphics display
; represents one bit in memory.  The pixel is white if that bit 
; is zero and is black if that bit is one.   Each row of dots
; represents the numbers in four 16-bit memory locations.  As 
; the computer executes a program, you can watch the dots change 
; as memory is modified.  This can be particularly nice if you 
; set the run speed pop-up menu to "Fastest Run Speed".

; The program simply stores the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... in
; consecutive memory locations, starting at location 20.

; (Note: This is a self-modifying program, an old-fashioned
; but cute idea.  The commands in locations 2 and 4 are
; changed as the program runs so that they load and store
; into different locations each time they are executed.)

lod-c 1   ; Put the starting number in location 20
sto 20

lod 20    ; Add 1 to the number in location 20 and put the
inc       ;     result into location 21
sto 21

lod 2     ; Modify the instruction in location 2 so it
inc       ;   loads from the next location.
sto 2

lod 4     ; Modify the instruction in location 4 so it
inc       ;   stores into the next location.
sto 4

jmp 2     ; Go back to the "LOD" instruction in
          ;     location 2.
