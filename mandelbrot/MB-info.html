<h2>Mandelbrot Viewer<br>Info and Instructions</h2>
<p>The image at the left shows a small piece of the Mandelbrot set,
as visualized using the <a href="MB.html">Mandelbrot&nbsp;Viewer</a> program.
The Mandelbrot set itself is a well-known mathematical object; see
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_Set">Wikipedia&nbsp;entry</a>
for more information about the set.</p>
<p>This page mostly discusses how to use the program.  
There is also a <a href="java/MandelbrotSettings/index.html"><b>large collection of examples</b></a> on another page.
And you can see the images from a <a href="/eck/mb24/">2024 Mandelbrot Calendar</a> 
that I made, with links to images from previous years' calendars.</p>
<p>(A user of this site, Robert Munafo, has made a version of this Mandelbrot viewer with many changes
and additions.  See <a href="http://www.mrob.com/pub/comp/eck-mandel/index.html">http://www.mrob.com/pub/comp/eck-mandel/index.html</a>.)</p>
<p>(Another user of this site, Bill Wood, has made a locally runnable version that 
uses the Rust programming langauge for the Mandelbrot computation, which is several times faster than
the web version.  See his
<a href="https://github.com/wpwoodjr/Mandelbrot-for-Docker-and-Kubernetes">GitHub&nbsp;repository</a>.)

<h3>How to Use the Program</h3>

<p>You can use <a href="MB.html">the program</a> without knowing anything about the
<a href="#math">mathematics</a> of the Mandelbrot set.
Drag your mouse (or your finger if using a touch screen) on the image, which draws a rectangular box around
part of the image.  When you release the mouse button,
the part of the image inside the box will be expanded to fill the entire image.  Look for interesting
things along the boundary of the black region, or along the filaments that extend from that
region.</p>

<p><b>About MaxIterations:</b> The program has to do some computation to decide whether a point is colored or is black.
The "MaxIterations" setting tells how much work it will do before giving up and making the point
black.  As you zoom in, you might need to increase MaxIterations to color in some black
regions that really should be colored.  For example, the image on the left below has black
pixels that should be colored.  Increasing MaxIterations from 250 to 2500 produced the
image on the right:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="too-few-iterations.png" width="200" height="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <img src="enough-iterations.png" width="200" height="150"></p>
<p><b>About the palette:</b>  The colors in the images are arbitrary.  The set of colors that are used is called the "palette"
in the program.  If you find that the colors in the image are too uniform, you can try <b>decreasing</b>
the value in the PaletteLength menu.  For example, changing the setting in that menu from 250 to 50 transformed
the picture on the left to the picture on the right:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="too-few-colors.png" width="200" height="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <img src="more-colors.png" width="200" height="150"></p>

<p>Conversely, if there are too many colors, try <b>increasing</b> the PaletteLength.  Here,
I increased it from 100 to 1000.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="too-many-colors.png" width="200" height="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <img src="less-colors.png" width="200" height="150"></p>

<p>If you change the PaletteOffset setting, the same set of colors will be used, but they will
be applied to the image differently.  Using a different PaletteOffset can sometimes bring out
details&mdash;and sometimes produces a more attractive image.</p>

<p>Several different sets of colors are available using the "Apply Standard Palette" button.
Select a palette in the menu below the button, then click the button to apply the selected
palette to the image.  The default palette, which the program uses when it starts up,
is called "Spectrum."  (It can be quite fun to set the popup menu to "Random" and just
keep hitting the "Apply Standard Palette" button.  The "Random" setting produces a different
palette each time it is clicked.)</p>

   
<p><b>About the Palette Editor:</b> (New in August 2019.) The button labeled "Show Palette Editor"
will pop up a dialog box that gives you almost total control over the palette of colors that are
used in the image.  Hover your mouse over an item in the palette editor to get information about
it.  For a more complete guide to the palette editor, see this
<a href="palette-editor-info.png" syle="white-space:pre">map of the palette editor</a>.</p>
   
<p><b>About Workers:</b> The Mandelbrot Viewer is a computation-intensive
program.  Most computers today are "multi-core", which means that they can do several
computations simultaneously.  To do that on a web page, the page can use several "worker
threads."  By default, the Mandelbrot program uses only one worker thread.  You can make it use
more by changing the setting of the "Workers" menu.  For example, if your computer is "quad-core",
then setting the "Workers" menu to 4 might make the program run four times as fast (assuming that
your computer is not doing any other intensive work and that the web browser actually lets
a page use all four cores).</p>

<p><b>More About Zooming and High Precision:</b>  I've already said that you can drag
a box on the image to zoom in.  There are also buttons for zooming in and zooming
out.  And if you are using a mouse, you have more flexible options for zooming.
Hold down the shift key as you make the box to zoom out instead of zooming in (the
current image will be shrunk down to the inside of the box).  Double-click on the
image to zoom in by a factor of two.  The point where you double-click will be moved
to the center of the image; if you want to leave that point in the same place,
hold down the ALT/Option key as you double-click.  You can also shift-double-click
to zoom out.</p>

<p>If you zoom in far enough, the program will switch to "high precision" computations.
Ordinary numbers on a computer have a limited number of decimal places.  As you zoom in,
those numbers will eventually not have enough accuracy to do the required computation.
The high-precision mode can handle any number of decimal places&mdash;but it is
much, much slower than computing with the usual numbers.  If you want to continue
in high precision mode, I suggest using a very small image, at least until you find
something interesting enough to make it worth the wait for a larger image.
Note that as long as "Interlaced Drawing" is turned on, the image starts to become recognizable
after 15 or 20% of the lines in the image have been computed.</p>

<p><b>Saving your Work:</b>  Some browsers (Chrome and Firefox) make it possible to
save the image from the program.  Just right-click the image and choose "Save Image"
or "View Image."  ("View Image" will open the image in a new page, and you can
save it from there.)</p>

<p>It is also possible to save all the settings that produced the image,
and you can load the saved settings back into the program to recover the
image.  Unfortunately, the method for doing that is kind of clunky...
Click the "Show XML Import/Export" button.  This will show a text input
box and some buttons that you can use to view, load, and save settings.
Click the "Grab Current Example" button to get the settings for the
current image.  They're in a format called "XML".  You don't need to
understand the format, but you will be able to tell what most of the data means.
You can copy-and-paste the settings from the text-input box into
a text editor program, where you can save them in a file.</p>

<p>To load some saved settings back into the program, click the
"Show XML Import/Export" button.  Open the file where the settings
are saved.  Copy-and-paste the settings from the file into the
text-input box in the Mandelbrot program.  And click the "Apply"
button to generate the image.  (Note that the settings can include an
image size, but that size is ignored when the settings are loaded.)</p>

<h3>About the Java Version</h3>

<p>This "web app" version of the Mandelbrot Viewer is a replacement for an older Java applet.
The Java version has more features than the web app (notably, more control over the
palette and the ability to distribute long computations among several computers on a network).
But applets are no longer well-supported in web browsers.  The standalone Java program
is still available.  <a href="java/MB-java.html">Click&nbsp;here</a> for information and
downloading links.</p>

<p>Note that the web app version and the Java version of the program use the same
settings files.  You can save settings from one version and use them in the other.</p>

<h3 id="math">Some Mathematical Details</h3>

<p>The Mandelbrot set is a set of <b>(x,y)</b> points in the plane.  It lies entirely inside the circle
centered at (0,0) with radius 2.  To find out whether the point <b>(a,b)</b> is in the Mandelbrot
set, do the following computation:  Let <b>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;a</b> and let <b>y&nbsp;=&nbsp;b</b>.
Then do the following step over and over:  Replace <b>(x,y)</b> with
<b style="white-space: nowrap">(x<sup>2</sup>&minus;y<sup>2</sup>&minus;a, 2xy&minus;b)</b>.  The number of times that you repeat this
step is the number of "iterations."  As you continue doing this step, if you get a value for
<b>(x,y)</b> that is outside the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2, then you know that
the initial point <b>(a,b)</b> is <b>NOT</b> in the Mandelbrot set.  The Mandelbrot set is defined
as the set of points <b>(a,b)</b> for which the iteration <b>never</b> leaves that circle.</p>

<p>Note that this computation can never prove that a point <b>(a,b)</b> is in the Mandelbrot set,
since that would require an infinite amount of computation.  In practice, we have to stop the
computation at some point, after doing a certain number of steps.  (The number of steps after
which the computation is stopped is what is called "MaxIterations" in the program.)</p>

<p>To get a visualization of the Mandelbrot set, do the iteration for one point in each
pixel in the image.  If the iteration reaches the maximum number of steps, color that
pixel black.  (Remember that this only means that the point might be in the Mandelbrot
set.)  Otherwise, the pixel is assigned a color that depends on 
the number of iterations that were done before (x,y) left the circle of
radius&nbsp;2. That number can be thought of as a sort of measure of how far the point
is from being in the Mandelbrot set&mdash;the more iterations, the closer the point is to the set.
In the program, the number of iterations is used to select a color from the palette.</p>

<p>After computing the image as described here, the program will make a second pass
in which it computes iteration counts at additional points. The data from these
additional points is averaged in with the data from the first pass.
This can give a smoother, more attractive image.  You can turn off this feature by
unchecking the box labeled "Use Second Pass."</p>

<h3 id="gallery">Some Loadable Examples</h3>

<p>Here are a dozen images from the program.  Click on one of the images to open
the program's web page and load that example.  The program will render a larger-size
version of the image.  You can then use the program to do some further exploration.
For example, click the "Zoom Out" button several times to see the neighborhood of
the example in the full Mandelbrot set.  You will usually see several striking images
along the way!  (There is also a large, unorganized
<a href="java/MandelbrotSettings/index.html">collection&nbsp;of&nbsp;examples</a> that
you can load into the program.)</p>
