<h1>xModels Info</h1>
<hr>

<p>Computer-generated graphics images are usually constructed in
two stages: <span class="nw">modeling</span> followed
by <span class="nw">rendering</span>.  In the modeling stage,
a geometric representation of the objects in the scene is constructed.
The rendering stage produces the actual image, based on information
in the model.</p>

<p>The <a href="xModels.html">xModels web app</a> lets you describe
scenes in a simple <span class="nw">scene description language</span>.
Scenes are rendered as <span class="nw">wireframe models</span>,
a very minimal kind of rendering which shows just the edges of all the
objects in the scene &mdash; even edges that are behind other objects.
The main point of the app is not to produce fancy images; the point
is to learn some of the basic ideas of geometric modeling, not to
produce attractive or realistic images.</p>

<p>(I wrote the original xModels program in the 1990s to use with
my book, <cite>The Most Complex Machine</cite>,
which was a survey of  the field of computer science. Even though the 
book is now largely outdated, the principles illustrated
by the program are still valid.  The original
program was written for Macintosh computers.  It was later translated
into Java, and now into the current version that runs on the Web.)</p>

<hr>
<h3>The xModels Interface</h3>

<p>xModels is designed to be easy to use. This section
describes the program's interface, but the major thing you 
need to learn about is the scene description language which
is discussed in the other sections of this page.</p>

<p>The <a href="xModels.html">xModels web page</a> has two main areas.  
At the top is a text editor where a scene description can be entered.  And on
the bottom is a large rectangle where the image will be
displayed.  Each area also includes some controls.</p>

<p>Above the text area is a popup menu that lists the sample scene descriptions
that are available.  (Note that scene descriptions are also referred to
as "xModels programs.")  Selecting an item from the popup menu will
show the corresponding program in the text editor.  The web page attempts to load nine 
sample programs into the popup menu.  The first six samples are tutorial 
examples that you can read to learn about the xModels scene description language.
You can probably learn enough about the language by
reading the tutorial examples to create your own scenes.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new scene description of your own, select "[New&nbsp;Program]"
from the pop-up menu.  The text area will be cleared, and you can enter your
own scene description.  The "Save" button lets you save the scene description from the text area
to a local text file on your computer. The "Load" button lets you select a
text file on from your computer to be loaded into the text area.
In most browsers, saving and loading files will use file save/open dialogs similar
to those used in other programs.  (Some browsers still use an older kind of file
handling. In those browsers, saving a file will look just like downloading a
file from the Internet, and loading a file will
look like uploading a file to the Internet.)  Saving and loading files is new
in November, 2023.</p>

<p>Beneath the text editor is a "Compile and Apply" button.  Click that
button to render the image described by the program in the editor.  But if
there are syntax errors in the program, an error message will be displayed
below the text editor instead.  In the case of an error, the input cursor
in the text editor will be moved to the point in the program where
the error was found.  Only the first syntax error in the program is
found and reported.</p>

<p>Turning to the image display area, note that there is an input box
above the image rectangle.  Type commands from the xModels scene
description language, and press return:
The commands will be applied to the image.  (Or if there is
a syntax error in the commands, then the error will be reported.)
This can be a great way to experiment with the scene description
language!</p>

<p>There is also a column of controls to the left of the image.
Clicking the "Clear and Reset" button will make the program forget
any xModels commands that have been executed and will clear the
image area.</p>

<p>The remaining controls in the graphics area allow you to
control animated scenes.  The animation capabilities of xModels
are discussed later on the page and in several of the tutorial
examples.</p>


<hr>
<h3 id="language">The Scene Description Language</h3>

<p>Scenes in xModels are described in terms of three coordinates, x, y, and z.
The computer's screen is the xy-plane, with the origin (0,0) at the center
of the image.  The positive y-axis extends upwards from this point,
and the positive x-axis points to the right.  The positive z-axis points directly out
from the screen towards the viewer, so that points in front of the screen have
positive z-values, and points behind the screen have negative z-values.  This is
a standard coordinate system for three-dimensional computer graphics.  Of course,
when a scene is rendered, all the points are <span class="nw">projected</span> onto the
screen, that is, onto the xy-plane.  But conceptually, the actual model can
extend into 3D space.</p>

<p>The image display area includes the square region with -10&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;10
and -10&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;y&nbsp;&lt;10.  Since the display area in not square,
it can actually extends beyond this range in the x direction.  There is no
way to increase or decrease the basic square region that is displayed, so scenes
must be sized to fit into this region.  (It is easy to scale objects up or down
in size to fit.)</p>

<p>The three-dimensional world is projected onto the xy-plane from a point
on the positive z-axis.  The z-coordinate of this point is called the
<span class="nw">view&nbsp;distance</span>, and its value can be specified as part of
a scene description.  (This name is somewhat deceptive.  Since the display
area always shows the same rectangle in the xy-plane, objects lying in that plane don't
look any different as the viewDistance changes.  The view distance affects object
that lie in front of or behind the xy-plane.)  The viewDistance can be set to "infinity" to
give what is called a <span class="nw">parallel projection</span>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, a scene description for xModels is a list of objects
that appear in the scene, plus a few special commands.  There are predefined commands,
such as <span class="cmd">circle</span> and <span class="cmd">cube</span>,
for adding objects to a scene, and predefined commands, such as 
<span class="cmd">red</span>, for changing the color that is used to draw objects.
There are special commands for specifying the background color,  view distance, 
and animation parameters.  There is also a special command for defining 
new objects and color names.</p>

<p>I should note that a scene description can contain comments.
A comment begins with a semicolon (;) and continues until the end of
the line.  For multiline comments, a semicolon is required on each line.
A comment doesn't have to start at the beginning of a line.  Comments 
in a program are for human readers; they are ignored by the computer.</p>

<p>Except in the case of comments, xModels doesn't pay attention
to ends-of-line.  They are treated just like spaces.  You can lay out
your program any way you like on the page.</p>

<p>The xModels language is not case-sensitive:  Upper and lower case letters
are considered to be equivalent, so that for example, you can use <i>xrotate</i>,
<i>xRotate</i>, and <i>XROTATE</i> interchangeably.
Names can consist of letters, digits, and
the underscore character&nbsp;(_).  A name must begin with a letter or with
an underscore.  Names can be of any length.</p>

<p>Numbers can include decimal points and exponential notation.
For example:  0, -17, 3.14, .5, 1.2e5.  With just a few exceptions,
anyplace where a number can appear in a program, a <span class="nw">number
range</span> can also appear.  Number ranges are used with animation, as 
described later on this page.  Examples of number ranges are 1:10, -1:3:10,
and 12::0.  (The only places where number ranges cannot be substituted for
numbers are in an <span class="cmd">animate</span> command and
for the first parameter of a <span class="cmd">lathe</span>
or <span class="cmd">extrude</span> command.)</p>

<p>As a final preliminary point, I will note that commas can be included
in a program to help make it more readable by humans.  However, the computer
ignores commas.  More specifically, it treats them exactly the same as
spaces.</p>

<h3>Special Commands</h3>

<p>The special commands in the xModels scene description language are <span class="cmd">animate</span>,
<span class="cmd">viewDistance</span>, <span class="cmd">background</span>, and
<span class="cmd">define</span>.</p>

<p>If the <span class="cmd">animate</span> command occurs at all in a program,
<b>it must be the first word</b> in the program (not counting any comments that might
precede it).  This command, which is used to specify the number of frames
in an animation, is explained below.</p>

<p>The <span class="cmd">viewDistance</span> command specifies the point
along the z-axis that is used as the center of projection.  An (x,y,z) point
is projected onto the xy-plane by drawing a line from the center of projection
through the point (x,y,z) and finding the (x,y) point where it intersects
the xy-plane.  Points with larger z-coordinates than the  projection point are not displayed.  The
<span class="cmd">viewDistance</span> command must be followed by
a parameter that specifies the z-coordinate of the projection point.
The parameter can be any positive number.  If the scene is an animation,
the parameter can be a number range.  The parameter can also be the word
<span class="cmd">infinity</span> which specifies projection from
infinity.  A program can contain at most one viewDistance command.
(However, you can use a <span class="cmd">viewDistance</span> command in the input box above
the image to change the view distance for an existing scene.) The 
<span class="cmd">viewDistance</span> command does not have to
come at the beginning of the program; however, it applies to the entire scene
in any case.
If no view distance is specified, a default value of 20 is used.  </p>

<p>The <span class="cmd">background</span> command is used to specify
the background color for the scene.  This command must be followed by
a color specification, which can be either a color name or an
RGB or HSB color, as discussed below.
The <span class="cmd">background</span> command can only be specified
once in a program.  (But you can change the background of the current
image by entering a <span class="cmd">background</span> command in
the text input box above the image.)  The default background color, if none
is specified, is white.</p>

<p>The <span class="cmd">define</span> command can be used to give a name to
an object.  Once a named object has been defined, it can be used in the same
way as any of the built-in objects, including in other
<span class="cmd">define</span> commands.
The word <span class="cmd">define</span> must be followed
by the name that is being defined, and then by the specification of the object
itself.  An object is generally a complex object, enclosed between
[ and&nbsp;], but that is not a requirement if the object specification
consists of a single command.  Defining an object does
<b>not</b> make the object appear in the scene.  To do that, you have
to include the defined name as part of the scene description.  The following
example defines a "wheel" to consist of a circle and three
lines:</p>

<pre>              define wheel [
                   circle
                   line
                   line rotate 60
                   line rotate -60
              ]
</pre>

<p class=np>You could then use the command <span class="cmd">wheel</span>
to add a wheel to the scene.  Here is an example that defines a
<span class="cmd">triangle</span> command.  The definition is a single
command, so it does not have to be enclosed between [&nbsp;and&nbsp;].
</p>

<pre>                define triangle polygon -1,-1 1,-1, 0,2
</pre>

<p class=np>It is also possible to define new color names.  For example:</p>
                
<pre>                define purple magenta 
                
                define pink rgb 1 0.5 0.5
</pre>

<p class=np>For color definitions, the definition should <b>not</b> be enclosed
between [&nbsp;and&nbsp;].</p>



<h3>Color Commands</h3>

<p>The xModels scene description language has several predefined command
for specifying colors.
When a color command is given, it sets the drawing color to be used
for all subsequent objects, up until the next color change.  Color changes
inside complex objects, that is between [&nbsp;and&nbsp;], have no effect past the
closing&nbsp;].  The default drawing color, if no color command has
been given, is black.</p>

<p>A color can be specified by one of the following color names:
<span class="cmd">red</span>, <span class="cmd">green</span>,
<span class="cmd">blue</span>, <span class="cmd">cyan</span>,
<span class="cmd">magenta</span>, <span class="cmd">yellow</span>,
<span class="cmd">black</span>, <span class="cmd">white</span>,
<span class="cmd">gray</span>, <span class="cmd">lightGray</span>,
or <span class="cmd">darkGray</span>.  You can add new color names with
the <span class="cmd">define</span> command.</p>

<p>Color can also be specified
with the <span class="cmd">rgb</span> command and with the <span class="cmd">hsb</span>
command.  The <span class="cmd">rgb</span> command lets you specify a color
by giving its red, blue, and green components.  It requires three parameters
to specify the three values.  The values must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.
For example:</p>

<pre>         rgb  0.5 0 0.5    ;  specifies a purple color
         rgb  0:1 0 0      ;  specifies a range of colors from black to red
</pre>

<p>The <span class="cmd">hsb</span> command is similar, except it specifies
a color by giving its hue, saturation, and brightness components.  Again, these
values must be between 0 and&nbsp;1.  (You can look this up in a graphics
textbook if you don't know what it means.)</p>


<h3>Objects</h3>

<p>There are six predefined objects in xModels:
<span class="cmd">line</span>, <span class="cmd">square</span>,
<span class="cmd">circle</span>, <span class="cmd">cube</span>,
<span class="cmd">cone</span>, and <span class="cmd">cylinder</span>.
These objects are sized so that each object just fits inside
a 1-by-1-by-1 cube, centered at the origin.  The <span class="cmd">line</span>
object stretches along the x-axis from (-0.5,0) to (0.5,0).  The
<span class="cmd">square</span> object has vertices at
(-0.5,-0.5), (0.5,-0.5), (0.5,0.5), and (-0.5,0.5).  The <span class="cmd">circle</span> has center
(0,0) and radius 0.5.  The <span class="cmd">cone</span> is oriented to point
upwards along the y-axis; it has height&nbsp;1, and the diameter of its base is&nbsp;1.
The <span class="cmd">cylinder</span> also has
a vertical orientation, with height and diameter equal to&nbsp;1.  
To include one of these objects, just list its
name in the scene description.  Usually, the name will be followed by
a transformation that affects the size, position, and orientation of the
object.</p>

<p>There are also four commands for creating an object out of a list of
points.  These commands are <span class="cmd">polygon</span>,
<span class="cmd">polygon_3d</span>, <span class="cmd">lathe</span>,
and <span class="cmd">extrude</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">polygon</span>
command takes a list of parameters that specify a sequence of (x,y) points.
The polygon consists of these points joined by lines.  Note that there
must be an even number of parameters, since there are two parameters per
point.  For example, the following command creates a triangle:</p>

<pre>             polygon  0,0 4,0 2,2</pre>

<p class=np>The commas in this command are optional.  (Remember that commas
are treated exactly like spaces.)
It's legal to have a polygon command with just two points.  In that case,
it specifies a line.  The polygon-3d is similar, except that it takes
a list of (x,y,z) points.</p>

<p>The <span class="cmd">lathe</span> command takes a list of (x,y) points, joins those points with
line segments, and then rotates the resulting curve about the y-axis to
obtain a three-dimensional object.  The original curve is actually copied
several times, at different angles of rotation.  These copies are then joined
with further line segments.  The number of copies must be specified as
the first parameter to the <span class="cmd">lathe</span> command.  The remaining
parameters specify the (x,y) points.  For example, the following command
makes four rotated copies of the line segment from (0,5) to (3,0) and
then connects them with lines to produce a pyramid:</p>

<pre>             lathe 4  0,5  3,0</pre>

<p class=np>It is legal to have a lathe command with just one point.  The result will be
a regular n-sided polygon lying in the xz-plane.</p>

<p>The <span class="cmd">extrude</span> command is similar to
<span class="cmd">lathe</span> in that it makes several copies of a curve
that lies in the xy-plane, and it then joins those copies with lines.  However, 
<span class="cmd">extrude</span> makes the copies by translating the
original curve along the z-axis.  Each copy is separated from the next
by one unit along the z-axis.  The z-values are centered about&nbsp;0.
for example, for <span class="cmd">extrude&nbsp;2</span>,
the two z-values are -0.5 and 0.5.</p>

<p>Besides all these basic objects, you can make <span class="nw">complex
objects</span>.  A complex object is a list of items enclosed between
a left bracket, [, and a right bracket,&nbsp;].  It can include objects
and color specifications.  Each object in a complex object can be
followed by its own set of transformations, as described below.  The
commands in a complex object can be basic objects, named objects created with
the <span class="cmd">define</span> command, nested complex
objects, and color commands.  A color change inside a complex object
affects the following commands inside the complex object, but it does
not affect things outside the complex object.</p>

<p>Because of the ability to nest complex objects inside other
complex objects, xModels is said to use <span class="nw">hierarchical
models</span>.</p>


<h3>Transformations</h3>

<p>Any object can be followed by a list of one or more transformations
that affect the size, position, and orientation of that object.  This 
includes complex objects.  Any transformation applied to a complex object
is applied to that object as a whole.  If an object inside a complex
object has its own transformations, they are applied first, followed
by the overall transformation of the object as a whole.</p>

<p>A transformation consists of a word specifying the type of transformation,
followed by one or more parameters.  For example, the command 
<span class="cmd">rotate&nbsp;30</span> specifies that the object
is to be rotated through an
angle of 30 degrees about the z-axis.  Some transformations take a variable
number of parameters.  For example, <span class="cmd">scale&nbsp;3</span>
will magnify the object by a factor of 3 in all directions, while
<span class="cmd">scale&nbsp;2,6,0.5</span> will scale it by
factors of 2 in the x-direction, 6 in the y-direction, and 0.5 in the
z-direction.</p>

<p>When an object is followed by several transformations, they are applied
in the order given.  For example, in</p>

<pre>           square  xtranslate 5  rotate 30</pre>

<p class=np>the square is first translated 5 units in the positive x-direction, and
is then rotated by 30 degrees about the origin.  Putting the transformations
in the opposite order:</p>

<pre>           square  rotate 30  xtranslate 5</pre>

<p class=np>gives a different result, since the square is first rotated and then
translated.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the transformations used in xModels, where A, B, C,
D, E, F, and G are numbers (or possibly, in the case of an animation, number ranges):</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="cmd">scale A B C</span> &mdash; Scales by factors of A in the x direction,
B in the y direction, and C in the z direction.  Scaling by a fractional amount makes
an object smaller.  Scaling by a negative amount reflects the object through the
corresponding coordinate plane.  The scaling is centered at the
origin; all other points move away from or towards the origin.  
<li><span class="cmd">scale A B</span> &mdash; same as "scale A B B".
<li><span class="cmd">scale A</span> &mdash; same as "scale A A A".
<li><span class="cmd">xscale A</span> &mdash; same as "scale A 1 1"; scales in x-direction only.
<li><span class="cmd">yscale A</span> &mdash; same as "scale 1 A 1"; scales in y-direction only.
<li><span class="cmd">zscale A</span> &mdash; same as "scale 1 1 A"; scales in z-direction only.
<li><span class="cmd">translate A B C</span> &mdash; Moves each point (x,y,z) to
(x+A,y+B,z+C). The effect is to move the object A units in the x-direction, B units
in the y-direction, and C units in the z-direction.
<li><span class="cmd">translate A B</span> &mdash; same as "translate A B 0".
<li><span class="cmd">translate A</span> &mdash; same as "translate A 0 0"; same as "xtranslate A".
<li><span class="cmd">xtranslate A</span> &mdash; same as "translate A 0 0"; moves an object A units in the x-direction.
<li><span class="cmd">ytranslate A</span> &mdash; same as "translate 0 A 0"; moves an object A units in the y-direction.
<li><span class="cmd">ztranslate A</span> &mdash; same as "translate 0 0 A"; moves an object A units in the z-direction.
<li><span class="cmd">xrotate A</span> &mdash; Rotates everything though an angle of A degrees about the
x-axis.  The x-axis is fixed, and everything else pivots around it.  The direction to
use for positive angles is determined by the "right-hand rule": Point the thumb
of your right hand in the direction of the positive axis, and the fingers of your
right hand will curl in the direction of a positive angle.
<li><span class="cmd">yrotate A</span> &mdash; Rotates everything though an angle of A degrees about the
y-axis.
<li><span class="cmd">zrotate A</span> &mdash; Rotates everything though an angle of A degrees about the
z-axis.
<li><span class="cmd">rotate A</span> &mdash; same as "zrotate A".  In the xy-plane,
this looks like a rotation about the origin, with positive angles representing counterclockwise
rotation and negative angles, clockwise rotation.
<li><span class="cmd">rotate A about B C</span> &mdash; Rotate through an angle
of A degrees about the line that starts at the point (B,C,0) and extends in the
same direction as the positive z-axis.  In the xy-plane, this is just rotation 
about the point (B,C).
<li><span class="cmd">rotate A about line B C D</span> &mdash; Rotate by an
angle of A degrees about the line that goes from the origin, (0,0,0), to the
point (B,C,D).  (The two words "about line" can also be written
as a single word "aboutline".)  If (B,C,D) = (0,0,0), nothing happens.
<li><span class="cmd">rotate A about line B C D E F G</span> &mdash; Rotate by an
angle of A degrees about the line that goes from the point (B,C,D) to the
point (E,F,G). 
<li><span class="cmd">xSkew A</span> &mdash; This is the transformation
which moves (x,y,z) to (x+Ay,y,z).  Lines that were perpendicular to the
xz-plane are tilted (or "skewed") to the left or right.
<li><span class="cmd">ySkew A</span> &mdash; This is the transformation
which moves (x,y,z) to (x,y+Ax,z).
<li><span class="cmd">xyShear A B</span> &mdash; This is the transformation
which moves (x,y,z) to (x+Az,y+Bz,z).  Lines perpendicular to the
xy-plane are skewed.  (I have not included a complete set of skew/shear
transformations, because I don't expect them to be used much.)
</ul>

<p>Note that although xModels is a 3-dimensional graphics program, you can 
restrict yourself to two dimensions if you want.  The names and semantics
of the transformations were chosen so that all the two-dimensional transformations
are available with reasonable names.  This explains the otherwise odd
<span class="cmd">rotate A about&nbsp;B&nbsp;C</span>, for
example.</p>

<p>It is important to understand what a list of transformations does to an 
object.  All the transformations are applied to the object before it is displayed.
So, <span class="cmd">square scale&nbsp;2&nbsp;5</span> is just a way
of specifying a 2-by-5 rectangle, and <span class="cmd">circle translate&nbsp;5</span>
is just a way of specifying a circle centered at the point (5,0).  You don't
actually see the object moving or changing shape.  For that,
you have to use an animation and specify a range of values for
the transformation.   In that case, each frame of the animation gets its own
transformation to specify the shape or position of the object in that frame.
The object can change from one frame to the next, because a different
transformation is used in each frame.</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>

<p>An animation is just a sequence of frames.  Each frame contains a 
separate image.  If the images don't change too much from one frame to the
next, the viewer will perceive continuous motion when the frames are
played back in rapid succession.</p>

<p>In xModels, a scene description that starts with the command
<span class="cmd">animate&nbsp;N</span>, where N is a positive
integer, is an animation with N+1 frames.  The frames are numbered from
0 to N.  (You should think of N as the number of intervals between
frames.)  Then, to get any kind of motion or change in the animation, 
you need to make some quantity change from frame to frame.  This is
done by using a number range in place of a number.  A number range consists
of a starting value, followed by a colon, followed by a final value.
In each frame of the animation, the number range represents a different
value.  For example, in an 11-frame animation, the number range
0:5 represents 0 in frame 0, 0.5 in frame 1, 1 in frame 2, ...,
and 5 in frame 11.  Thus, the scene description:</p>

<pre>              animate 10
              circle scale 0:5
</pre>

<p class=np>shows a circle that grows from a size of 0 in the first frame to 
a size of 5 in the last frame.  And</p>

<pre>              animate 30
              square scale 5 rotate 0:90
</pre>

<p class=np>shows a 5-by-5 square pivoting through a 90-degree turn about the origin.
Note that the value 5 in this example is the same in each frame.  You don't
need to use a number range for each value in an animation &mdash; only for the
values that you actually want to change during the animation.</p>

<p>By adding additional parameters to the animate command, you can make
"segmented animations."  For example, the command
<span class="cmd">animate&nbsp;30&nbsp;50</span> specifies an
animation with two segments.  The first segment has 31 frames, and the
second segment has 51.  The final frame of the first segment is also the
first frame of the second segment, so there are 81 frames in all.  (Remember
that the numbers 30 and 50 actually specify the number of intervals between frames.)
An animation can contain any number of segments. The first frame of the
animation, the last frame, and any frame that is on the boundary
between two segments are called <span class="nw">key frames</span>.</p>

<p>A number range used in a segmented animation must specify a value for
each of the key frames.  Thus, it must have exactly as many colons as
there are segments in the animation.  For example, the number range 10:5:7 
could be used in a two-segment animation.  During the first segment, 
the value ranges from 10 to 5, and during the second segment, it ranges
from 5 to 7.  The number range 0:0:10  has the constant value 0 throughout
the first segment, and then its value ranges from 0 to 10 during the
second segment.  Sometimes, you want a quantity that changes at a
constant rate during the whole animation, rather than at different
rates in different segments.  The notation for doing this is to use
two or more colons in a row, with no numbers  between.  For
example, 0::10  represents a quantity that varies evenly from 0 to 10
across both segments of a two-segment animation.</p>

<p>The xModels web page has a set of controls for controlling animations,
located to the left of the image display area.  There is a "Run&nbsp;Animation"
button for starting or resuming an animation, a "Pause&nbsp;Animation" button
for pausing a running animation, and a "Next&nbsp;Frame" button that will
display just the next single frame of an animation that is paused.  These
buttons are only enabled when using them makes sense.</p>

<p>A "Frames per Second" popup menu controls the speed at which an
animations run, ranging from 60 frames per second down to 1 frame per second.</p>

<p>And an "Animation Style" menu specifies what
happens in an animation when the last frame is reached.  If this menu
is set to "Loop," the animation is repeated starting back
at frame zero.  If it is set to "Back&nbsp;And&nbsp;Forth," the
animation is played backwards, then forwards again, and so on.
If it is set to "Once&nbsp;Through," the animation is paused
when it reaches the final frame.</p>
