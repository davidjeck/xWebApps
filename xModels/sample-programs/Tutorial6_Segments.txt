; Tutorial 6: Segments

; An animation can have "segments."  For example, the command
; "animate 30 50" creates an animation with a segment that
; contains 31 frames, followed by a segment that contains
; 51 frames.  The segments are "spliced" together because
; the final frame of the first segment is the same as
; the first frame of the second segment.  The total number
; of frames is 81.

; This file defines an animation with four segments.
